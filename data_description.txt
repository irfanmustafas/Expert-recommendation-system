Dataset provided in the competition contains three types of information:
    1. Expert tag data：which contains IDs of all expert users, their interest
       tags, and processed profile descriptions.
    2. Question data：which contains IDs of all questions, processed question
       descriptions, question categories, total number of answers, total number
       of top quality answers, total number of upvotes.
    3. Question distribution data：290,000 records of question push notification,
       each contains a question ID, an expert ID and whether or not the expert
       answered the question. We will divide the training set, validation set
       and test set based on these records.


Please also note that:
    1. Training set is used for the training of the model. Validation set is
       used for online real-time evaluation of the algorithm. Test set is used
       for the final evaluation.
    2. All expert ID and question ID is anonymized to protect user privacy.
    3. Also for privacy protection purpose, we will not provide the original
       descriptions of the questions and the experts.Instead, we will provide
       the ID sequence of the characters (each Chinese character will be assigned
       an ID) and the ID sequence of the words after segmentation (each word will
       be assigned an ID). You are free to use either one or both.
    4. Validation and testing labels will not be published. The contest committee
       will use them for online evaluation and final evaluation only.


All data is included in two files in the following formats:

user_info.txt: expert tag file
    Each line represents one expert user, which has four properties separated by
    /tab. The four properties are:
        1. Anonymized expert user ID: the unique identifier of each expert user.
        2. Expert user tags: there will be multiple tags, i.e. 18/19/20 may
           represent baby/ pregnancy/parenting.
        3. Word ID sequence: User descriptions (excluding modal particles and
           punctuation) are first segmented,then each word will be replaced by
           the Character ID, i.e.284/42 may represent "Dont Panic".
        4. Character ID sequence: User descriptions (excluding modal particles
           and punctuation) are first segmented, then each character will be
           replaced by the Character ID,i.e. 284/42 may represent “BE”.
    note: when a property is null we will use a placeholder "/" to represent it.

user_info.txt: [expert_id, expert_user_tags, word_id, character_id]


question_info.txt: Question data file
    Each line represents one question, which has seven properties separated by
    /tab. The seven properties are:
        1. Anonymized question ID: the unique identifier of each question.
        2. Question tag: there will be single tags, i.e. 2 may represent fitness.
        3. Word ID sequence: User descriptions (excluding modal particles and
           punctuation) are first segmented, then each word will be replaced by
           the Character ID, i.e. 284/42 may represent “keyword1 keyword2”.
        4. Character ID sequence: User descriptions (excluding modal particles
           and punctuation) are first segmented, then each character will be
           replaced by the Character ID, i.e.284/42 may represent “BE”.
        5. Number of upvotes: The total number of upvotes of all answers to
           this question. It may indicate the popularity of the question.
        6. Number of answers: The total number of answers to this question.
           It may indicate the popularity of the question.
        7. Number of top quality answers: The total number of top quality answers
           to this question. It may indicate the popularity of the question.
    note: when a property is null we will use a placeholder "/" to represent it.

question_info.txt: [question_id, question_tag, word_id, character_id,
                    upvotes_count, answers_count, top_quality_answers_count]


The training set will contain one file with the following format:
    Invited_info_train.txt: Question distribution data
        Each line represents one question push notification record, which
        includes the encrypted ID of the question, the encrypted ID of the
        expert user and if the expert user answered the question (0=ignored,
        1=answered), separated by /tab.

    Invited_info_train.txt: [question_id, expert_id, (0=ignored, 1=answered)]

    Validation set and test set will each contain one file
    (invited_info_validation.txt and invited_info_test.txt) with the same format
    as the invited_info_train.txt. Each of the files will contain a part of the
    push records.
