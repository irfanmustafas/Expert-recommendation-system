# Expert-recommendation-system
Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many algorithms have been suggested for providing recommendations. These algorithms typically perform differently in various domains and tasks. In this repository we deal with different algorithms we used to build a recommendation system for suggesting how likely a user would answer a question using the byte cup data.

## General instructions 
All the code is in python and can be easily run by just cloning/downloading the repository. It already has all the features generted and the code for executing different algorithms can be found in the **Expert-recommendation-system/code** directory.

## Running the code
You need to have python 2.7 setup on your machine for running code on this repository. The code could be simply run with the following command **python file_name**

## Instructions for Running various Algorithms
* Linear and Logistic regression
